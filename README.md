## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- SQLite

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoeAlNaggar/node-api-backend.git
   cd node-api-backend
   ```

2. **Create and activate Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment in the tools directory
   cd tools
   python -m venv cymatevenv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   cymatevenv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source cymatevenv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm install
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**
   
   Run the automated setup script to populate the database with all security tools and categories:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Create all necessary categories (Network, Web, Malware, Threat Intelligence)
   - Populate the database with 19 security tools
   - Show progress and provide a summary
   - Handle errors gracefully
   
   **Note:** This should only be run once during initial setup. The script uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` so it's safe to run multiple times without creating duplicates.

6. **Start the API server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## ⚠️ Security Considerations & Ethical Use

### 🔒 **IMPORTANT: Authorized Use Only**
This toolkit contains powerful security testing tools that can identify vulnerabilities and perform network reconnaissance. **You MUST have explicit written permission** before using these tools on any systems, networks, or applications that you do not own.

### 📋 **Legal Requirements**
- ✅ Obtain proper authorization before testing
- ✅ Comply with all applicable laws and regulations  
- ✅ Use only for legitimate security research and testing
- ✅ Report vulnerabilities through responsible disclosure
- ❌ **DO NOT** use for unauthorized access or malicious purposes

### 🛡️ **Technical Security**
- **Virtual Environment**: Always use the provided virtual environment to avoid conflicts
- **File Uploads**: Uploaded files are stored temporarily and should be managed appropriately  
- **API Security**: Consider implementing authentication and rate limiting for production use
- **Network Isolation**: Run in isolated environments when testing

### ⚖️ **Disclaimer**
The authors of this toolkit are not responsible for any misuse, damage, or legal consequences resulting from the use of these tools. Users assume full responsibility for ensuring their use complies with all applicable laws and ethical guidelines.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Python Virtual Environment Issues**
   - Ensure you're in the `tools` directory when creating the virtual environment
   - Activate the virtual environment before installing dependencies
   - The API will automatically detect and use the virtual environment Python executable

2. **Database Migration Errors**
   - Run `npm run setup` to populate the database with security tools
   - Check that the SQLite database file has proper permissions
   - Ensure all migration scripts are run in order

3. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the PORT environment variable or stop other processes using port 3000

4. **Python Tool Execution Errors**
   - Verify that all required Python packages are installed
   - Check that the virtual environment is activated when running tools
   - The service automatically detects the Python executable in `tools/cymatevenv`

5. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Run `python setup/scan_requirements.py` to scan for all required packages
   - This will generate an updated requirements.txt with all discovered dependencies

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the logs in the console output
2. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
3. Ensure the database is properly initialized
4. Check that the Python virtual environment is activated
